# Upgrade Guide

{{site.data.alerts.callout_primary}} You should always update TastyIgniter to the [latest version]({{site.siteurl}}/download). {{site.data.alerts.end}}

{{site.data.alerts.warning}}The upgrade process will affect all files and folders included in the TastyIgniter installation. This includes all the core files used to run TastyIgniter. If you have made any modifications to those files, your changes will be lost.{{site.data.alerts.end}} 

As of TastyIgniter 2.0 or later, When a new version of TastyIgniter is available you will receive an update message in your TastyIgniter Admin Panel. 
All you have to do to update TastyIgniter is to click the **Update** notification button at the right top. 
After that you will be redirected to the **Update Center** page.

There are two methods for updating - the easiest is through the **Update Center**, which will work in most cases. 
If it doesn't work, or you just prefer to be more hands-on, you can follow the manual update process.

## Back up TastyIgniter

Before you get started, it's a good idea to back up your website. This means if there are any issues you can restore your website. 

### Backing Up Your Database
Visit your TastyIgniter admin page at /admin. Go to `Maintenance` under `System -> Tools` and `Select tables to backup` then click the `Backup` button. On the next page, make sure `Add DROP TABLE statement` is `No`, click the `Backup` button again and your backed up database file will appear under the `Exisiting Backups` Tab. You can download and keep the file on your computer.

### Backing Up Your TastyIgniter Site
Backup your files using FTP clients or cPanel filemanager to copy or create a zip of all the existing TastyIgniter files and folders.

### Restoring Your Database From Backup
Visit your TastyIgniter admin maintenance page. Under `Exisiting Backups` tab click the `Restore` button next to the database backup you wish to restore.

## Manual Update

If the one-click upgrade doesn't work for you, don't panic! Just try a manual update.

### **Step 1:** Replace TastyIgniter files
1. Get the [latest TastyIgniter](https://tastyigniter.com/download) zip file
2. Unpack the downloaded zip file
3. Open the unpacked folder `TastyIgniter-x.x.x`
4. Locate and `delete` the `database.php` file in `system/tastyigniter/config/` folder
5. Using your FTP client, upload all the files and folders inside the `TastyIgniter-x.x.x` folder to your web host. Uploading all the files might take a few minutes on the FTP client.
6. Do NOT replace/overwrite your existing `system/tastyigniter/config/database.php` file.

### **Step 2:** Update your installation
After uploading the files of the new version to your web host, visit the setup page at "/setup" like: www.myrestaurant.com/setup. Following the instructions on the setup page will update your database to be compatible with the latest code.

{{site.data.alerts.warning}}Warning: DO NOT proceed if you see the Database page asking you to enter your database details, this means your old database.php file has changed. Fix this by restoring your old database.php file then return to Step 1{{site.data.alerts.end}}


### **Step 3:** Do something nice for yourself
Clear your site (if enabled) and browser cache at this point so the changes will go live immediately. Otherwise, visitors to your site (including you) will continue to see the old version (until the cache updates).
